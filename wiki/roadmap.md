# Currently Planned Features for 2.0:

VMT Material setup allowing for setting up VMT Materials the same way dumped rpak materials are currently setup, except straight from their source files

VMT Export for easier setup of reticles or glowy bits straight from blender

QC Editor for editing things such as sequences in the QC File via a small gui in blender

QoL Changes such as:
-   Blender 4 support
-   Automatic material setup setting up the images for a new rpak material from a folder
-   remaking the expot panel for better exporting and removing bugs
-   Error warnings on potential problems after export when pressing export
-   and more...


Got ideas for features? suggest them [Here](https://github.com/EM4Volts/Perimeter/pulls)!

Most features for Perimeter are things i personally need/want and find useful, as such please dont expect frequent updates, for suggestions please give good reasons as to why a feature should be added.
